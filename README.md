## Updating Node.js version
Ensure Node Version Manager is installed on your machine by running
```bash
nvm -v
```
If you get some version number as _1.x.x_, then you already have nvm installed. However, if you don't get such version number, but an error then consider installing nvm from [this link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/download/1.1.10/nvm-setup.exe). Download the `nvm-setup.exe` file and install it by following the installation wizard.
After installation, check for successful installation by running above command in terminal, this time you should see a version number as output.

Now, after having **nvm** installed, go on updating Node version by running,
```bash
nvm install lts
```
This will install latest LTS version. And after installation, you will see a command in the last line of the output as,
```bash
Installation complete. If you want to use this version, type

nvm use 18.x.x
```
Copy and run the last command of ypu output to use recently installed Node version.
Now, we have installed and set up latest Node versionðŸ¤˜
